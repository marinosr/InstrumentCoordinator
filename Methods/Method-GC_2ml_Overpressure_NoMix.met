#Autosampler sequence for providing 2ml sample from vials @ overpressure.


***SETUP***
METHODNAME=2.5 ml GC injection with vials at overpressure.
MAXSYRINGEVOL=2.5              #ml
MAXSYRINGESTROKE=55          #mm
LOCATIONS=./Methods/AS-Locations/AS-Locations.csv                   #XYZ coordinates of positional commands
AUTOITLOCATIONS=./Methods/SHM-Commands/ShimadzuPaths.csv  #Paths for PC automation scripts. 
GCSOLENOIDPIN=33

***SEQUENCE***
#Devices = AS (autosampler), PC (tell computer running this code to do a task), SHM (use shimadzu software to do something)
#t = time in seconds, if all set to 0 events will happen as fast as possible
#command = a command to be parsed by run_method()
#arguments = optional numeric arguments that get used by a particular command
